# Bitcoin Stock Portfolio

This project is intended to investigate whether a CFO can invest some funds in Bitcoin. A report will be prepared in this project that summarizes how Bitcoin performs against the general stock market. After evaluating Bitcoin's performance, a web application will be built in order to automate the evaluation of any other stock of interest to assess their key metrics and viability for interested investors.

Ensure all the required applications are installed from the requirements document.

To run the web application locally, copy and paste the following command in your command line `streamlit run app.py --server.enableXsrfProtection false`
